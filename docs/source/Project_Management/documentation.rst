Documentation
=============

Overview
--------

.. todo::

   Summarize the purpose of design documentation in robotics projects, including how it enables knowledge transfer between team members and semesters. Explain the role of design reviews (PDR, CDR) as gates in the project lifecycle, and emphasize that thorough documentation reduces rework and improves project quality. Include tips on maintaining living documents that evolve with the design.

Project Proposal and the Research Phase
---------------------------------------

The initial project proposal should outline intent, scale, and feasibility. This process should be conducted by the indiviudal interested in leading the proposed project. This should include:

 * Problem Statement

   - What could this be used for?
   - Who would use it?

 * Previous Work

   - What other projects exist?
   - What resources exist?
   - Are there off-the-shelf products to help get started?
   - How much did it cost?

 * High-Level Requirements

   - What does success look like?

 * Scope outline

   - What electronics are needed?
   - What mechanical systems are needed?
   - What software is needed?
   - What skills are needed? 

 * Timeline Overview

   1) feasible to make meaningful progress each semester 
   2) involved enough to engage ~10 engineers?

.. note::

   Projects are not necessaily meant to be novel research or marketable products. Projects should demonstrate reasonable technical depth to occupy ~10 engineers for 2~4 semesters.

Upon completion of the project proposal, the project advance to the `Research Phase` and the Project Lead (PL) will be provided with:

 1) An assigned project space within the TURTLE Lab.
 2) The ability to recruit members at the start of the semester through the TURTLE Common application.
 3) A $100 per semester budget for inital exploration and research.

.. note::

   The `Research Phase` is not intended to produce any functional hardware, but rather to explore the feasibility of the proposed project and refine the scope and requirements. There are intentionally no clear functional deliverables for this phase, and the budget is intended to support buying multiple cheap components for testing and exploration. 

Preliminary Design Review and the Prototyping Phase

Optional Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In proceeding through the PDR, it may be relevant that there are other necessary topics that must be addressed. There are additional templates that exist to aide in the uniformity and delivery of these Design Reviews. These templates are not required, but if a project :

 * Risk Management
 * Systems Engineering
 * Project Management Tools
 * Testing Plans

.. note::

   TURTLE Robotics has no affiliation with an accredited Internal Review Board (IRB) or Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). If your project involves human subjects or animal testing, TURTLE cannot approve these activities. If your project requires IRB or IACUC approval, you must either rescope your project or seek collaberation from an entity with such affiliation. 


Critical Design Review and the Production Phase
-----------------------------------------------


.. todo::

   Explain how documents are named, stored in Git/Drive, and reviewed before release.

Knowledge Capture
-----------------

.. todo::

   Describe post-mortem practices, lessons-learned logs, and how information is shared across teams.

Publishing & Access
-------------------

.. todo::

   Outline who approves public releases, how credentials are managed, and where archives live.

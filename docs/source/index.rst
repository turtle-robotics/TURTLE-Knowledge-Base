Welcome to the TURTLE Robotics Knowledge Base!
==============================================

This knowledge base is designed to provide a supplimentary resource for TURTLE Robotics members and anyone interested in robotics. It contains documentation on the common tools, software, and hardware used in our projects.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.

   to do

   Add sections 
   Mechanical 
      - Fasteners
      - Bearings
      - Gears
   Mechanical_and_Design/urdf
   Mechanical_and_Design/materials
   Electronics
      - sensors 
      - proper power
      - soldering?
      Electronics_and_Power/microcontrollers
      Electronics_and_Power/arduinoide
   Programming & Software
      - git
      - simulators 
      - Dual boot/linux
      Programming_and_Software/raspi
      Programming_and_Software/ros
      Programming_and_Software/cv

   Theory
      - like all of it lmfao
      Theory_and_Concepts/path_planning
      Theory_and_Concepts/kinematics
      Theory_and_Concepts/controls
      - I want to intentionally leave this to undergrads. I know that zach/others would help in a heartbeat, but I think its more important that this be by current turtles
   Project Management
      - tbh I need to talk to mcgarity

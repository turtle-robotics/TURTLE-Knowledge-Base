Welcome to the TURTLE Robotics Knowledge Base!
==============================================

This knowledge base is designed to provide a supplimentary resource for TURTLE Robotics members and anyone interested in robotics. It contains documentation on the common tools, software, and hardware used in our projects.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.

   Add sections 
   Mechanical 
      - Fasteners
      - Bearings
      - Gears

   Electronics
      - sensors 
      - proper power
      - soldering?

      - I want to intentionally leave this to undergrads. I know that zach/others would help in a heartbeat, but I think its more important that this be by current turtles

      - tbh I need to talk to mcgarity

Project Management Methodologies
--------------------------------

.. todo::

   Agile -> interchangable parts (scrum, git-based manangement)
   waterfall -> NASA only builds one rocket
   rapid prototyping -> generations of designs (V1.0 -> V2.0)

Planning Cadence
----------------

.. todo::

   Explain sprint/phase small-scale how to run a meeting, and long-scale how to plan goals

Task Tracking
-------------

.. todo::

   Describe how tasks are entered, prioritized, and reviewed (e.g., google sheetsm Jira, Notion, GitHub Projects).

Resource Allocation
-------------------

As the project lead, you are fundamentally accountable for the budget, lab space, and deliverables of your team. That does not mean you are expected to any, or all, of the work yourself. It is reccommended to make planning a team conversation, and to ensure that your team is in agreement with what you are working towards, and how you 
 but you should ensure that these resources are planned and tracked throughout the project lifecycle.

.. todo::

   Capture budgeting best practices, including tracking expenditures against the approved budget for each phase, identifying cost-saving opportunities during prototyping, and planning for contingencies. Document lab space scheduling conventions (reservations, access times, safety handoffs), guidelines for shared equipment reservations and conflict resolution, and tips for managing inventory of project materials and components.

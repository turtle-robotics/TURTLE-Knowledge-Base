OS Configuration
----------------

A common way to install an operating system on a Raspberry Pi is to use the Raspberry Pi Imager tool. This tool allows you to easily select and flash an OS image onto a microSD card.

1. Download and install Raspberry Pi Imager from the official Raspberry Pi website: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
2. Insert a microSD card into your computer using an SD card reader.
3. Open Raspberry Pi Imager.
4. Click on "Choose Device" and select the Raspberry Pi model you want to use.
5. Click on "Choose OS" and select the desired operating system for your Raspberry Pi.
6. Click on "Choose Storage" and select the microSD card.
7. Click on "Next"
8. (Recommended) Customize the OS settings (e.g., set hostname, enable SSH, set password, configure Wi-Fi).
9. Click on "Write" to start the flashing process.
10. Once the flashing is complete, safely eject the microSD card from your computer.
11. Insert the microSD card into your Raspberry Pi, connect to a monitor (and keyboard/mouse if possible), and power it using a USB-C/MicroUSB cable.
12. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the initial setup of your Raspberry Pi.

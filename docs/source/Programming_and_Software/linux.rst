Ubuntu
=================
Ubuntu is a Linux distrubtion based on Debian and comprised mostly from free open-source software.

It is **highly recommended that you dual boot** your computer with Windows and Ubuntu, or use a virtual machine (VM) to run Ubuntu on your computer. This way, you can use Windows for SolidWorks and other applications that are not well supported on Linux, while using Ubuntu for programming and robotics development.
